1st project coding 

FYI only, I was spending most of my time trying to find a website tha thas data in csv files as well as API. Most of my time was to figure out API, I gather a last min data on Monday and just started creating code right after. The chart didn't make sense so i wasn't too comfortable in putting it in the presentation. 
Jeff also helps me alot with API and guide me through my dataset as well.
